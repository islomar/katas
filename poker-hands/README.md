##TODO
* Implement the missing rules
* Leave only one way of creating a card
* Pending FlushRule.creatematchingRuleCardsExtractor()... indeed, why did I need it??
* Do I need white and black players?
* Create REAL unit tests...
* Improve PokerGame:
  * Extract responsibilities
  * Do not have "Tie." inside there
* Avoid using if()
