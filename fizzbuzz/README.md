#FizzBuzz kata

[Mythical FizzBuzz kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataFizzBuzz), with some variants, like printing "Wizz" if the number is divisible by seven).

Unfortunately, I started commiting "too late", so you won't be able to see the first baby steps of the kata (I promise you'll see it next time I do it in a different language ;-)).

I wanted to play around with Java8: streams, lambdas, Function, Predicate, etc. I felt like trying to get rid of any *if()* condition or any explicit/traditional loop.

With the rules design, adding new different rules like "write Meeeec if the addition of the digits of the number is 17", would be extremely easy to be done.
