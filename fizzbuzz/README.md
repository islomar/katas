#FizzBuzz kata

[Mythical FizzBuzz kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataFizzBuzz), with some variants, like printing "Wizz" if the number is divisible by seven).

Unfortunately, I started commiting "too late", so you won't be able to see the first baby steps of the kata (I promise you'll see it next time I do it in a different language ;-)).
